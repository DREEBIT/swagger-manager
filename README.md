# Swagger-Manager

Swagger-Manager is a web-tool built with SailsJS and AngularJS to document and test your REST-API. Create and manage your REST-APIs and store information persistently.

Run API-tests manually and automatically to verify your HTTP-Responses from your REST webservice. Used test-tools are test-runner Mocha, assertion-library Chai, and plug-in Chai-HTTP.

## Features

- Backend
-- Build with SailsJS
-- RESTful webservice
-- Supports different database adapters like MySQL or MongoDB

- Frontend
-- Build with AngularJS
-- Material Design

- Swagger Support
-- link a SwaggerUI distribution for viewing your specifications

## Requirements

- NodeJS, npm
- Bower
- Ruby, Compass
- Apache Web-Server
- Database (MySQL, MongoDB)

## Install and Run

### SetUp Database

Database Model is build with MySQL-Workbench and is located at ./database_model. Please read the [SailsJS documentation](http://sailsjs.org/) for configuring different database adapters.

#### MySQL

Create a database with phpmyadmin and synchronise database-model with your web-server-database.
View [SailsJS documentation](http://sailsjs.org/) for setting up adapters in ./backend/config/connections.js.

API-Testing refer to connections mysql_local and mysql_production according to the environments development and production.

Example:

```javascript
./backend/config/connections.js

mysql_local: {
    adapter   : 'sails-mysql',
    host      : 'localhost',
    port      : 3306,
    user      : 'root',
    password  : 'example',
    database  : 'api-docs-db'
},
mysql_production: {
    adapter   : 'sails-mysql',
    host      : 'localhost',
    port      : 3306,
    user      : 'swagger-manager',
    password  : 'example',
    database  : 'api-docs-db'
}
```
